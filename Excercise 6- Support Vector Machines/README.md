## Support Vector Machines

In this part of Machine Learning, you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets
will help you gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs. Then you will be using support vector machines to build a spam classifier.
