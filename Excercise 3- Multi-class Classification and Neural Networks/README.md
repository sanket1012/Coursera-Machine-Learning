## Multi-Class Classification and Neural Network

Here you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks model to recognize hand-written digits (from 0 to 9).
You are given a data set in [ex3data1.mat](https://github.com/sanket1012/Coursera-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Excercise%203-%20Multi-class%20Classification%20and%20Neural%20Networks/ex3data1.mat) that contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits.
The '.mat' format means that the data has been saved in a native Octave/MATLAB matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv file. These matrices can be read directly into your program by using the load command. After loading, matrices of the correct dimensions and values will appear in your program's memory. The matrix will already be named, so you do not need to assign names to them.

As logistic regression cannot form more complex hypotheses as it is only a linear classifier, one can also implement the model using Neural Networks:
