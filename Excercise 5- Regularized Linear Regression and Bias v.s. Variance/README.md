# Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance

In this part of Machine Learning, you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.

First, you will implement [regularized linear regression](https://github.com/sanket1012/Coursera-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Excercise%205-%20Regularized%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20Bias%20v.s.%20Variance/Regularized%20Linear%20Regression) to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

Next, you will go through some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine the effects of [bias v.s. variance](https://github.com/sanket1012/Coursera-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Excercise%205-%20Regularized%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20Bias%20v.s.%20Variance/Bias%20v.s.%20Variance).
