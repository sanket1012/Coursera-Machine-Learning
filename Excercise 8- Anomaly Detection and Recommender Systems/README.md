# Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

In this part of Machine Learning, we will implement the [anomaly detection algorithm](https://github.com/sanket1012/Coursera-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Excercise%208-%20Anomaly%20Detection%20and%20Recommender%20Systems/Anomaly%20Detection%20System/README.md) and
apply it to detect failing servers on a network.

In the second part, we will use collaborative filtering to build a [recommender system](https://github.com/sanket1012/Coursera-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Excercise%208-%20Anomaly%20Detection%20and%20Recommender%20Systems/Recommender%20Systems/README.md) for movies.
