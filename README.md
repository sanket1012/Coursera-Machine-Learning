-----------------------
This course provides an introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.

Topics include:
* Supervised learning
  * Parametric/non-parametric algorithms
  * Support vector machines
  * Kernels
  * Neural networks
* Unsupervised learning
  * Clustering
  * Dimensionality reduction
  * Recommender systems
  * Deep learning
* Best practices in machine learning
  * Bias/variance theory
  * Innovation process in machine learning and AI

This repos is for showcasing my work in Machine Learning Course condudted on Coursera and doesnot mean any substitute to that course. If required one can use this as reference to basic understanding of Machine Learning Programming implemented in Matlab
